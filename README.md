# My Data Science & Analytics Portfolio

Welcome! This repository is my professional portfolio, containing a curated collection of my projects in data analysis, machine learning, and visualization.



## 1. Analysis of the 2024-2025 Electric Vehicle (EV) Market

* **Project Goal:** To analyze a modern dataset of 170,000+ EV registrations (updated to 2025) to identify market trends, brand dominance, and technology adoption.
* **Skills:** Data Cleaning (pandas), Grouped Imputation, Feature Engineering, Data Visualization (Seaborn, Matplotlib), Data Storytelling.
* **Key Findings:**
    1.  **Explosive Growth:** The market is in a "hockey stick" growth phase, with BEV (Battery Electric Vehicle) adoption growing exponentially since 2021.
    2.  **"Two-in-One" Market:** The market is clearly split into two distinct segments: long-range BEVs (200-300+ mile range) and short-range PHEVs (25-50 mile range).
    3.  **Technology Trends:** BEV range is improving steadily year-over-year, while PHEV range remains static, indicating different design goals.
